# Cybersecurity Risk Detector

## Overview
The **Cybersecurity Risk Detector** is a machine learning-based project aimed at identifying and mitigating cybersecurity risks. This project analyzes data to detect potential vulnerabilities or threats, ensuring enhanced security.

## Features
- Identifies potential cybersecurity risks.
- Uses machine learning for threat identification.
- Processes data to detect anomalies.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Frameworks/Libraries:**
  - Scikit-learn
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
- **Version Control:** Git

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dirshaye/Cybersecurity_Risk_Detector.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd dirshaye-cyber_security_risk_detector
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Ensure `veri.csv` is available in the root directory.
2. Train the model or run the detector:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Results and trained models will be saved as `eniyi.joblib`.
